# Site Downtime Investigation Report: Database Overcapacity

## Executive Summary

On March 5, 2024, between 10:00 AM and 12:45 PM EST, our primary web service experienced significant downtime, affecting approximately 65% of our users. This period of instability was characterized by delayed response times and widespread service timeouts, traced back to an overload on our central database server. This report details the events, root cause analysis, and the measures taken to resolve and prevent future incidents.

## Timeline of Events

### Detection and Initial Response
- **10:00 AM EST:** Anomalies detected by automated monitoring, indicating increased error rates and latency.
- **10:05 AM EST:** Network issues initially suspected but quickly ruled out.

### Identifying the Root Cause
- **10:20 AM EST:** Increase in user complaints about account access and slow loading times.
- **10:30 AM EST:** Database identified as the bottleneck due to high query volume.
- **10:45 AM EST:** Misconfiguration in database cache settings identified and temporarily fixed.

### Resolution Efforts
- **11:00 AM EST:** Escalation to database engineers for in-depth analysis.
- **11:30 AM EST:** Inefficient query from a recent feature found to be causing overload.
- **12:00 PM EST:** Deployment of a hotfix to optimize the query; database server restarted.

### Incident Closure
- **12:45 PM EST:** System performance returned to normal; incident resolved.

## Root Cause and Resolution

The investigation concluded that the downtime was caused by an inefficient database query related to the latest feature update, leading to excessive load. The solution involved optimizing the query with proper indexing and adjusting database cache settings, followed by a server reboot to clear the backlog of queries.

## Corrective and Preventive Measures

To prevent future incidents, the following actions have been initiated:

- **Database Change Audit:** Review of recent database changes to identify any inefficiencies.
- **Enhanced Monitoring and Alerts:** Implementation of improved monitoring for query performance and load.
- **Performance Testing Protocol:** Introduction of performance testing for all future releases with database changes.
- **Database Configuration Review:** Comprehensive analysis of database configurations to ensure optimal performance.
- **Engineer Training:** Additional training on database management and optimization for development staff.

These measures are designed to enhance our infrastructure's resilience and ensure the reliability of our services.
